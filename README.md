# OriginalFractal
Original Fractal made by the Originor himself.
In this assignment I will create my own original fractal design. I can create fractals with circles, squares, polygons or any other shape. I may want to search the web for ideas, or try to come up with my own variation. Vi Hart has an excellent youtube video "Infinity Elephants" which describes many similar fractals.
